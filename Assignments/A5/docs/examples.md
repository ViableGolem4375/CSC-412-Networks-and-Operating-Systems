## Identify Two Difficult Parts of the Assignment

One area I expect to be time consuming is understanding how to work with UTF-8 encoding for part 3 of the assignment. This is something I am almost entirely unfamiliar with and from my brief research done for A1, I recall this being something which was complicated and that I did not understand fully. As a result, I will likely experience some difficulty with this part of the assignment.

The second area which will likely be difficult is the board decompression portion of the assignment. I expect this to be difficult as similarly to UTF-8 encoding, since I am entirely unfamiliar with data compression techniques, so figuring out how to implement this functionality will likely be challenging.

## Real World Examples

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Think of dynamic memory allocation like booking a table at a restaurant.

Imagine you walk into a restaurant without a reservation. You tell the host how many people are in your party, and they find a table that fits your group. If more friends join later, you can ask the host to move you to a bigger table, or if some leave, you might move to a smaller one. The restaurant adjusts the seating based on your needs at that moment.

Similarly, in dynamic memory allocation, a program requests memory from the system as needed. If it needs more memory later, it can request additional space, or if it no longer needs some memory, it can release it back to the system. This flexibility helps manage resources efficiently, just like the restaurant manages its tables to accommodate different party sizes.

### Data Compression

Think of data compression like packing a suitcase for a trip.

When you pack a suitcase, you want to fit as much as possible into a limited space. To do this, you might roll your clothes instead of folding them, use vacuum bags to compress bulky items, and fill every nook and cranny with smaller items like socks or toiletries. The goal is to maximize the available space without leaving anything important behind.

Similarly, data compression involves taking a large amount of data and encoding it in a way that uses less space. Just like with your suitcase, the goal is to reduce the size of the data while still retaining all the essential information. When you need to use the data again, you “unpack” it, just like you would unpack your suitcase at your destination.
