# Part 3 Unicode

### 1. Who founded the Consortium? Who is represented among the current members, and how might that affect decisions being made for Unicode?

The Unicode Consortium was founded by Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis in 1991.

The current members include many different computer software and hardware companies. The full members capable of voting include Adobe, Airbnb, Apple, Google, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce, and Translated.

These companies may affect decisions being made about Unicode as they all have their own personal interests related to the subject. One example is that the priority of what different characters (such as emojis) get added to the Unicode Standard as all of these companies will have different metrics for which ones they would like added. They also will be attempting to take into account more global requirements for the Unicode Standard based on where they operate as they will make decisions based on different technical requirements to work with different systems around the world, along with including characters from different languages.

### 2. Find a language that is not yet in Unicode, has only recently been supported (e.g., in the last 10 years), or is/was missing important characters. What is/was missing, and how does this affect the users of the language?

A language which has only been recently included within Unicode is Mundari, a language spoken in India, which uses the Nag Mundari script for writing in the language. This language was only recently added in Unicode 15.0 about 2 years ago in September of 2022. Previous to its inclusion, practically the entire written script for the language was missing from Unicode, preventing it from being used digitally.

This caused a great deal of difficulty for speakers of the language as their language was unrepresented in the digital world. As a result, they were forced to rely on other existing, similar scripts, or use makeshift solutions to the problem which had the potential to cause inconsistencies in communication to others. All of this resulted in a very difficult time for speakers of the Mundari language when trying to interact with the digital world.

### 3. For this question, you will need to work with a classmate! Make sure to coordinate so that you outline opposing positions for Part A (e.g. if you outline the ‘for’ position, your partner defends the ‘against’ position). Then, come together and discuss Part B!




#### Step A: Outline either the position for or against Han Unification

Position against Han Unification:

There are a few different points as to why Han Unification is a bad idea and shouldn't be incorporated into the Unicode Standard. Firstly, while the similarities between the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages are plentiful, they are not entirely the same. There are still a great deal of differences between the characters within these languages and in some cases, there can be similar looking characters which have entirely different meanings. This can result in potential misunderstandings between speakers of these languages and the loss of the different nuances that exist within the languages.

Secondly, the different languages included within Han Unification feature a lot of different stylistic differences between characters within these languages. If they are to be unified into one Unicode Standard, this can result in problems where a character is written slightly differently between say Chinese and Japanese causing the character to look wrong when written digitally which could affect readability of the language for its speakers.

Thirdly, there are technical problems regarding displaying text in these languages which could be caused by Han Unification. These languages may require different font sizes to display correctly without causing different sizing problems. The problem that Han Unification poses in this context is that since they are to be all encoded to the same standard, problems could arise where a character in one language appears as a totally different size to the characters around it. This can negatively affect readability of the language digitally as attempting to read something where the characters all display as different sizes is jarring and difficult.

Lastly, there is a resistance from the different speakers of these languages to Han Unification. Different speakers of the languages across Asia feel as if Han Unification is imposing a sort of linguistic imperialism where their language is being misrepresented, and the culture surrounding the language is being lost in the process. Notably, this upsets a large number of people across Asia resulting in negative opinions about the subject overall.

#### Step B
### A bullet-point summary of your discussion for Step B

- Han Unification causes unicode characters in these 3 languages to be more efficient and scalable.

- Han Unification makes exchanging of data easier.

- Han Unification makes the displaying of text to be consistent.

- It can make things visually confusing depending on the characters used.

- It can make conversing harder as some characters have nuance which is lost in Han Unification.

- Han Unification can be seen as culturally insensitive to those who speak these languages.

#### Describe the tradeoff that Unicode has made with this decision 

Since the Unicode Consortium decided to go through with implementing Han Unification, there are some tradeoffs to this desicion. A benefit to this is that it gives a lot of space efficiency, by unifying a lot of similar characters, the number of space needed to store these characters was dramatically reduced making it more space efficient.

Another benefit is that processing of the characters was simplified by a great deal. Since the character set has been unified, things such as text processing and exchanging of data between systems were simplified significantly as the complexity of handling multiple character sets has been eliminated.

Lastly, interoperability between these languages digitally has been increased signinficantly. Since the three languages have been unified, communication between speakers of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean has been made easier.

However as outlined in the previous section, Han Unification came with some drawbacks, like the different nuances of the three languages being lost in the unification potentially causing confusion between speakers of the languages. Also, stylistically the languages are a bit different which can cause problems with characters not looking exactly the way they are supposed to causing issues with readability. There have also been issues regarding not every existing character being included in the unification, namely characters used within surnames or ancient historical texts which are not frequently used. These issues combined with the various technical challenges of making sure that the languages display properly with one another and push back from speakers of the languages have caused some tradeoffs for the implementation of Han Unification.
